Photonvision Libraries
===========================

robotpy's photonvision wrapper is deprecated.  Support is now available from the 
vendor supported photonlibpy package.  The package is installable via pip:

`pip install photonlibpy`

Refer to the `Photonvision site <https://docs.photonvision.org/>`_ for information
on using the API.
